# Practical Labs for Reinforcement Learning course, MSc AI @ UvA 2019.

## Lab 1:
Non compulsory Lab on classical Reinforcement Learning approaches applied to a gridworld. Multiarmed Bandit [Code](https://github.com/PhilLint/RL/blob/master/RL_WC1_bandit.ipynb),
[Lab1](https://github.com/PhilLint/RL/blob/master/lab1/lab1.ipynb) using OpenAIs Gym, Policy Evalutation, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration and Monte Carlo Prediction, Monte Carlo control with 
$\epsilon$-greedy policy were implemented for the Game of Blackjack.

## Lab 2:
[Lab2](https://github.com/PhilLint/RL/blob/master/lab2/david_12152498_12140910_lab2.ipynb) using OpenAIs Gym, Temporal Difference Learning (SARSA, Q-Learning), Deep Q-Network (DQN), Monte Carlo REINFORCE were implemented on the 
windy gridworld and the Cartpole environment.
